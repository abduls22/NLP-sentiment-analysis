This application uses natural language processing (NLP), through the use of the NLTK python package, to perform real-time sentiment analysis on user-given text. Through analyzing the given text, it determines if the sentiment of the user is positive, negative, or neutral.

Before running this application, run the command "npm install".

Then to run this application, navigate to NLP-sentiment-analysis/API and open a second terminal. In the first terminal, run the command "python main.py", and in the second terminal, run the command "npm start".

Then enter in some text, possibly an opinion on something or a review about something, and press submit. The web application will then display the result of the sentiment analysis, as in if the sentiment of the user was found to be positive, negative, or neutral.
